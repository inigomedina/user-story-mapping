## Preface

One of the beneficial consequences of the rise of Agile software development is the notion of splitting up large sets of requirements into smaller chunks.

When a product is built story-by-story, with each story’s implementation fully integrated into the software product, everyone can see the product grow.

By using stories that make sense to users, developers can steer the project by determining which stories to build next. This greater visibility helps encourage greater participation from users—no longer do they have to wait a year or more to see what the development team’s been up to.

But this chunking has some **negative consequences**.

-It's easy to lose the **big picture**.

    -You can end up with a jumble of pieces that don't fit into a coherent whole.

    -You can end up building a system that isn't really helpful to the users, because you've got lost in the details.

Story mapping is a technique that provides the big picture that a pile of stories so often misses.

Benefits of the big picture:

-It helps communicate effectively with users.
-It helps everyone involved avoid building unnecessary features.
-It provides an orientation for a coherent user experience.
-It sparks conversations.

A **common mistake**, especially among developers, is to understand stories as a one-way communication. From someone who is in charge of the requirements to them. Just the opposite. Developers need to understand what their users are trying to achieve and that brings them to collaborate in building stories that capture those users' needs.

**Kent Beck** originated the notion of a story. He called out, highlighted **communication** as a key value of effective teams. Stories are the building blocks of communication between developers and the rest of the team. Story maps structure those building blocks, and thus enhance this communication process.

_Communication process is the most critial part of software development itself._
