## Preface by Martin Fowler

One of the beneficial consequences of the rise of Agile software development is the notion of splitting up large sets of requirements into smaller chunks.

When a product is built story-by-story, with each story’s implementation fully integrated into the software product, everyone can see the product grow.

By using stories that make sense to users, developers can steer the project by determining which stories to build next. This greater visibility helps encourage greater participation from users—no longer do they have to wait a year or more to see what the development team’s been up to.

But this chunking has some **negative consequences**.

-It's easy to lose the **big picture**.

    -You can end up with a jumble of pieces that don't fit into a coherent whole.

    -You can end up building a system that isn't really helpful to the users, because you've got lost in the details.

Story mapping is a technique that provides the big picture that a pile of stories so often misses.

Benefits of the big picture:

-It helps communicate effectively with users.
-It helps everyone involved avoid building unnecessary features.
-It provides an orientation for a coherent user experience.
-It sparks conversations.

A **common mistake**, especially among developers, is to understand stories as a one-way communication. From someone who is in charge of the requirements to them. Just the opposite. Developers need to understand what their users are trying to achieve and that brings them to collaborate in building stories that capture those users' needs.

**Kent Beck** originated the notion of a story. He called out, highlighted **communication** as a key value of effective teams. Stories are the building blocks of communication between developers and the rest of the team. Story maps structure those building blocks, and thus enhance this communication process.

_Communication process is the most critial part of software development itself._

## Preface by Alan Cooper

In Mary Shelley’s famous science-fiction novel, Frankenstein, the mad Doctor Frankenstein builds a creature from disparate pieces of dead humans and brings the creature to life with the then-new technology of electricity.

**Yet this is what software developers attempt to do all the time.**

They add good features to software, one at a time, and then wonder why few users love their product.

**The heart of the conundrum is that developers are using their construction method as a design tool.**

It's entirely reasonable that programmers build software one feature at a time. That's a perfectly good strategy, proven over the years. What has also been proven over the years is that, when used as a method for designing the behavior and scope of a digital product, **one-feature-at-a-time** yields a Frankenstein monster of a program.

The practice of **designing** software behavior and the practice of **building** that software are distinctly different. They are typically performed by different people with different skill sets.

Interaction designers spend many hours observing users and mapping behavior patterns.

Programmers spend many hours deciding data structures, code organization, and algorithms.

The **secret** is that both strains of practice need to **collaborate**. Then, the work becomes electric and has the potential to create a **living**, breathing product.

**Teamwork** breathes live into the monster and makes people love it.

**While the idea of collaboration is neither new nor particularly insightful, it is actually very difficult to do effectively.**

Collaboration is hard because of the lack of a **common tongue** for those two sister disciplines. It is really hard to express a design problem in programming terms. It is also really hard to express a development problem in design terms.

**Story Mapping is the Rosetta Stone for our digital age.**

Despite protestations to the contrary, Agile development is not a very useful design tool. It is a way of thinking about development that is design-friendly, which is a very good thing, but by itself it won't get you to a product that users love. On the other hand, so many times we have seen good designs, well documented, given to developers —Agile or not— who manage to kill the essence of the design in the process of implementation.

**Interaction design is all about finding the user's truth and telling it as a narrative.**

**Software development is all about breaking those narratives into tiny, functional chunks and implementing and integrating them.**

**The designer's story is a formalized version of the user's story.**

The conventional corporate world has proven that it is nearly impossible for a team of two or three hundred people to build a product that people love. Meanwhile the startup community has proven that a team of four or five people can build small products that people love, but even these little products eventually grow big and lose their spark.

The only way we are going to build big software that is not a Frankenstein monster is by learning how to integrate the disciplines of software design and development.

## Preface by Marty Cagan

I’ve also been brought in to try to help companies that are not doing so well. Startups racing to get some traction before the money runs out. Larger companies struggling to replicate their early innovation. Teams failing to continuously add value to their business. Leaders frustrated with how long it takes to go from idea to reality. Engineers exasperated with their product owners.

**What I’ve learned is that there is a profound difference between how the very best product companies create technology products, and the rest.**

I mean **everything** from how leaders behave to the level of empowerment of teams; to the way teams work together; to how the organization thinks about funding, staffing, and producing products; to the culture; to how product, design, and engineering collaborate to discover effective solutions for their customers.

This book is titled User Story Mapping, but you’ll soon see it is about much more than this powerful yet simple technique. This book gets to the heart about how teams **collaborate**, **communicate**, and ultimately come up with good stuff to **build**.
